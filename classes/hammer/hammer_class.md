# The Hammer

## Class Concept
The Hammer is a Victorian-era enforcer who learned to take punishment on behalf of others through years of brutal street fights and backroom negotiations. They've developed an almost supernatural ability to draw enemy fire and turn that aggression back on their attackers.

## Class Identity & Theme
Rather than the typical "noble protector" archetype, the Hammer embodies the concept of controlled aggression and deliberate provocation. They're not just a tank - they're a psychological manipulator who weaponizes their own suffering and uses taunts as a tactical weapon. The cosmic horror theme manifests in their ability to absorb eldritch influence and reflect it back as raw hostility.

## Core Archetypes

### 1. Provocation & Taunt
- Cards that force enemies to target the Hammer
- Effects that manipulate enemy intentions and targeting
- Control over the flow of combat through redirection

### 2. Retaliation
- Temporary effects that punish enemies for attacking
- Turn defensive positioning into offensive opportunity
- Stack retaliation effects for massive counter-attacks

### 3. Self-Defense (Keyword)
- Defensive cards that can target any ally
- Double effectiveness when targeting yourself
- Flexible protection for team or enhanced self-protection

## Combat Role

### Strengths
- **Enemy Control**: Redirects enemy attacks away from fragile allies
- **Counter-Attack Damage**: Punishes enemies for focusing the Hammer
- **Flexible Defense**: Self-Defense keyword allows protecting allies or doubling self-protection
- **Psychological Warfare**: Disrupts enemy patterns through forced targeting

### Weaknesses
- **Limited Direct Offense**: Few straightforward attack cards
- **Resource Dependent**: Needs to set up taunt + retaliate combos
- **Vulnerable When Isolated**: Less effective without allies to protect
- **Setup Required**: Takes time to establish defensive/retaliation engine

## New Buff Definitions

### Taunt (X)
**Applies To**: Character
**Description**: "For the next ${this.stacks} enemy action(s) that would target a single character, redirect the target to this character instead."

### Retaliate (X)
**Applies To**: Character
**Description**: "When this character is targeted by an attack, deal ${this.stacks} damage to the attacker. Expires at end of turn."

### Self-Defense (Keyword)
**Applies To**: Playable Card
**Description**: "Double this effect when targeting yourself. Cards with Self-Defense can target any ally."

## Starting Deck
The Hammer begins with cards focused on basic protection and minor provocation:

- **1x Crude Taunt**: Common Skill, taunts 1 enemy for 1 action
- **1x Defensive Stance**: Common Skill with Self-Defense keyword
- **1x Knuckle Sandwich**: Common Attack with minor damage and brief retaliate
- **Basic cards** (Strikes, Defends as normal starter cards)

## Token Card

### Hurtful Words and Gestures
**Cost**: 0 energy
**Type**: Skill
**Rarity**: Token
**Mechanical Text**: Apply Taunt (1) to yourself. Transient.
**Flavor Text**: "Sometimes the cruelest cuts come from the sharpest tongues."

This token represents the Hammer's ability to generate provocative situations through verbal and gestural antagonism, creating tactical opportunities without spending significant resources.

## Design Philosophy
The Hammer is designed to create interesting tactical decisions around risk and reward. Players must balance the benefits of drawing fire (enabling Self-Defense, setting up retaliation) with the danger of becoming overwhelmed. The class rewards careful resource management and timing, as retaliation effects are temporary and taunt stacks are limited.

The class avoids purely parasitic mechanics - Taunt works with any character, Retaliate deals damage regardless of other class cards, and Self-Defense enhances any block-granting effect. This ensures the Hammer's cards remain useful even when mixed with other classes' strategies.
