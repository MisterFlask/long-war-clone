## Synergy Patterns

### Core Synergies
1. **Self-Targeting → Self-Defense**: Targeting yourself doubles defensive effects
2. **Provocation → Retaliate**: Many cards provide both mechanics together
3. **Being Targeted → Benefits**: Powers and effects that reward enemy focus

### Deck Archetypes
1. **Pure Tank**: Focus on Self-Defense scaling and high block values
2. **Retaliation Engine**: Stack retaliate effects for counter-damage
3. **Control**: Use provocation to manipulate enemy targeting patterns
4. **Hybrid**: Combine defensive scaling with retaliation punishment

## Power Level Assessment
- **Commons**: Baseline functionality with archetype enablers (6-9 damage, 6-12 block)
- **Uncommons**: Multi-archetype cards and enhanced effects (8-16 block, 2-3 stacks)
- **Rares**: Build-defining powers and massive scaling (15-30 block, permanent effects)

## Balance Considerations
- Provocation effects only last one action per enemy, requiring ongoing investment
- Retaliate effects expire at end of turn, preventing permanent abuse
- Self-Defense requires setup, creating risk/reward decisions
- Token generation provides tactical flexibility without overpowering

The Hammer class creates interesting decisions around when to provoke enemies, how to balance offense and defense, and when to commit resources to large defensive plays. All mechanics work with other classes' cards, avoiding parasitic design while maintaining strong internal synergies.
