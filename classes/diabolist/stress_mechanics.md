# Diabolist Stress Mechanics

## Stress-Scaling Cards

The Diabolist features several cards that scale with current stress level, encouraging risk/reward gameplay:

### Damage Scaling
- **Desperate Strike**: Base 4 damage + current Stress
- **Anguished Blast**: Base 6 damage + (2 Ã— current Stress)

### Defense Scaling
- **Tormented Defense**: Base 5 Block + current Stress


## Stress Generation

Several cards generate stress as either a cost or side effect:

### Self-Stress Cards
- **Anguished Blast**: Applies 1 Stress to self after dealing damage
- **Tormented Defense**: Applies 1 Stress to self after gaining Block
- **Mass Enfeeblement**: Applies 1 Stress to self for powerful effect
- **Panic Inducement**: Applies 1 Stress to self while affecting enemy

### Party-Wide Stress
- **Shared Burden**: Applies 1 Stress to all party members to draw 2 cards


## Design Philosophy

The stress system creates a tension between:
1. **Power vs Risk**: Higher stress increases effectiveness but brings closer to breaking point
2. **Resource Management**: Stress as both cost and benefit
3. **Timing**: Knowing when to push stress higher vs when to release it
4. **Team Impact**: Some effects spread stress to allies for greater benefits

## Integration with Other Mechanics

### With Essence
- Essence Mastery IV provides Fearless, which helps manage stress
- High Essence builds can afford more stress manipulation

### With Bloodprice
- Both systems encourage spending resources (health/stress) for power
- Can create dangerous but powerful combinations

### With Binding
- Stress-scaled damage can help finish enemies to trigger Binding
- Successful Bindings provide Essence to eventually gain stress mitigation

## Recommended Stress Thresholds

- **0-2 Stress**: Safe zone, minimal scaling benefits
- **3-5 Stress**: Good risk/reward balance, moderate scaling
- **6-8 Stress**: High risk, high reward territory
- **9-10 Stress**: Extremely dangerous, maximum power but imminent curse risk
