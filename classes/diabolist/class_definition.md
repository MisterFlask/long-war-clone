# The Diabolist

A former member of occult societies who has delved too deeply into forbidden pacts and infernal contracts. They wield dark powers at great personal cost, binding enemies with eldritch forces while managing their own corruption and stress.

## Core Mechanics

### Bloodprice
- Cards with Bloodprice can be paid with health if insufficient energy is available
- If you lack sufficient energy, pay the specified health per unpaid energy to play the card
- This mechanic allows for desperate plays but at significant cost

### Binding X
- A debuff that marks enemies for execution
- If an enemy has Binding X, it dies at the end of the turn if its current HP is X or less
- When an enemy dies to Binding, the Diabolist gains 1 Essence
- All attacks that inflict Binding have Ethereal and Exhaust properties

### Essence
- A special resource that accumulates when enemies die to Binding effects
- Essence provides increasingly powerful buffs at defined thresholds:
  - 3+ Essence: +1 Lethality
  - 6+ Essence: +2 Lethality, +1 Dexterity
  - 10+ Essence: +3 Lethality, +2 Dexterity, +5 Block at start of turn
  - 15+ Essence: +4 Lethality, +3 Dexterity, +8 Block at start of turn, Fearless (1)

### Weakness Debuff
- Key debuff that reduces damage dealt by 33%
- Can be applied to enemies as control
- Some Diabolist cards may apply Weakness to self for powerful effects

### Stress Interactions
- Many cards increase the Diabolist's stress or party stress for powerful effects
- Some attacks and skills scale with current stress level
- Cards that benefit from high stress provide risk/reward gameplay

## Resource Economy
- Primary Energy: Standard energy system
- Secondary Health: Via Bloodprice mechanics
- Tertiary Essence: Gained through successful Binding kills
- Stress Management: Both cost and benefit for various abilities

## Playstyle
The Diabolist is a high-risk, high-reward class that excels at:
- Executing weakened enemies through Binding
- Trading health and stress for immediate power
- Building up Essence for scaling late-game power
- Controlling enemy damage through Weakness debuffs
- Managing multiple resource systems simultaneously

The class rewards careful planning and risk assessment, as the player must balance immediate survival needs against long-term power accumulation through Essence generation.
