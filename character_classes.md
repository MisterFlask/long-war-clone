The Occultist
A former member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn who left after glimpsing truths too terrible for even their esoteric brotherhood. They've studied Dee's Enochian manuscripts and corresponded with European alchemists, understanding the old ways that predate Newton's clockwork universe.
The Engineer
A brilliant Royal Society member who designed railways and bridges before witnessing impossible geometries in the Forge-Tyrant's mechanical servants. Now they use their intimate knowledge of Victorian machinery to identify what should and shouldn't exist according to proper physics.
The Alienist
An early practitioner of the new science of psychiatry who studied under Charcot in Paris. They've seen how the Forge-Tyrant's influence manifests as a peculiar industrial madness - workers who dream in steam and pistons, managers who sketch impossible blueprints in their sleep.
The Soldier
A veteran of the Afghan wars or the Sudan campaign who's faced horrors in the colonies that the Empire pretends don't exist. They've learned that enough firepower solves most problems, and their experience with "frontier madness" has given them a practical approach to impossible situations.
The Naturalist
A radical Darwinist who's discovered that evolution isn't always forward progress - some branches were deliberately pruned. They study the old folklore of Britain's countryside, understanding that ancient warnings about cold iron and running water weren't mere superstition.
The Aristocrat
Old money with older secrets. Their family library contains books that predate the printing press, and their connections reach into Parliament's most shadowed committees. They've seen this threat to their Empire and decided to act where lesser nobility would simply flee to their country estates.
The Burglar
A reformed cracksman who learned their trade in London's rookeries before discovering that some locked doors should remain closed. Their skills at entering places they shouldn't be have proven invaluable for infiltrating cult meetings and corrupted factories.
The Spiritualist
A medium who originally performed fashionable s√©ances for the wealthy until they made contact with something genuinely otherworldly. They understand that Britain's old saints and forgotten gods still linger, and these ancient powers despise the Forge-Tyrant's mechanical blasphemy.
