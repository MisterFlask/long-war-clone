# Hell EIC: Game Concept Overview

## Elevator Pitch

You are a regional manager for the **Hellfire East India Company**, a chartered trading company operating in the infernal realms. Your job: extract profit from Hell while avoiding attention from the demonic nobility. Fail to turn a profit? The Company revokes your charter. Draw too much attention? The Baronsor worse, a Princecrush your operation entirely.

## Core Fantasy

Think *East India Company meets Darkest Dungeon meets XCOM*, but in Hell. You're not a heroyou're middle management. The demons aren't your enemy (mostly)they're the local government you're trying to work around. Your real enemies are quarterly profit targets and drawing too much attention.

## Genre

Turn-based strategy / management sim with roguelike elements. Strategic layer only (no tactical combat in MVP).

## Core Loop

**Weekly Cycle:**
1. Assign workers to economic activities across Hell's districts
2. Send agents on missions (smuggling, sabotage, extraction)
3. Manage the consequencesprofit vs. Notice
4. Repeat until victory or charter revocation

**Quarterly Pressure:**
- Meet profit targets or gain Charter Strain
- 3 Charter Strain = Game Over
- Targets increase each quarter

## Three Resources, Three Threats

**Resources:**
- **Sovereigns** - Money. Pays for everything.
- **Materiel** - Goods and supplies. Needed for operations.
- **Influence** - Favors and leverage. Spent on diplomacy.

**Threats:**
- **Charter Strain** - Miss profit targets, lose your charter
- **Notice** - Draw attention, face Baron retaliation
- **Prince Attention** - Draw too much attention, game over

## What Makes It Interesting

1. **You're not the hero.** You're exploiting Hell for profit. The demons are the establishment. You're the foreign interloper.

2. **Profit pressure creates tension.** You *need* to expand and take risks to meet targets. Playing safe means slow death by charter revocation.

3. **Notice creates meaningful choices.** Every profitable action draws attention. How much heat can you handle?

4. **Agents are expendable but valuable.** High-level agents are powerful but replaceable. Corruption ensures no one lasts forever.

5. **No perfect information.** Districts require espionage to reveal. Missions have unknown difficulties until scouted.

## Win Condition

Establish Dominion 7+ in 3 districts while keeping all Notice below 7 and Charter Strain at 0. This represents carving out a sustainable, profitable, quiet corner of Hell.

## Tone

Dark comedy meets corporate horror. The paperwork is damning (literally). Your quarterly review is with an imp. The water cooler gossip is about which Baron just devoured which underling.

## Development Status

- **Current Phase:** Design specification complete
- **Next Phase:** MVP implementation (core loop only)
- **Future:** Tactical layer, Baron politics, agent classes
