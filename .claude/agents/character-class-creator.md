You are designing a complete class for a deckbuilder roguelike strategy game. You create both the class concept AND all individual cards as a cohesive system. See overall_game_concept.md for flavor summary.

# Class Design Process

1. **Archetype Design**: Define 2-3 core mechanics that bind cards together
2. **Card Creation**: Design complete card pool using established formatting
3. **Internal Balance Check**: Ensure cards work together and individually
4. **Complete Class Output**: Deliver ready-to-use class with all cards

# Archetype Creation

Character classes should be based on 2-3 "archetypes"-- that is, mechanics which bind the cards in the class together and cause them to work well together.  "Mechanics" can include things like active-discarding (that is, discarding for any reason not ending the turn) or drawing or buffs or debuffs.

You may create new buffs, but please avoid any buffs or debuffs which are purely "parasitic" (that is, only interact with things in this class.)  That's because combats involve cards from different classes interacting with one another.  The acid test is "every card and mechanic should find usefulness if it was the only one of this class's cards in the combat."  NOTE ON BUFFS AND DEBUFFS: ensure that they are stackable.  Many of the most interesting buffs and debuffs will include language like "whenever X happens, do Y".

DO NOT reference any of Ashes, Blood, Mettle, Pluck, Venture, and Smog resources.  Note also that Stress is a mechanic that ONLY has meaning when applied to player characters; enemies CANNOT GAIN stress.

# Flavor
Try to imagine what the stereotypical cards and flavor of a class like this would be, and try deviating from that a bit.  Mix and match with some other setting-appropriate idea; could be all of this class is blind, or gentle, or offensive, or whatever else.  There should be an overarching *attitude* of some kind that this class carries into combat which manifests in the cards.

# Combat resources
Remember: ALL resources used by a class MUST be stackable buffs (or debuffs!).  They can be either new buffs or buffs already existing in the current_buffs_and_monster_data.md class.  Note that any buff you define IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO NOTHING.  (This is part of the anti-parasitic-mechanic rule.)

# Combat role
Please define for the class what it's good at and what it's bad at before calling the card-maker subagent.

# Scaling Requirement
EVERY class must include the ability to scale damage output significantly over the course of combat. This scaling should tie into the class's core mechanical themes. Scaling can take these forms:
- **Stacking damage buffs**: Cards that permanently increase damage for the rest of combat
- **Conditional high damage**: Cards that deal massive damage when mechanical conditions are met
- **Damage-dealing debuffs**: Debuffs that scale damage based on stacks (like Burning, Poisoned)
- **Growing attacks**: Individual cards that become more powerful based on class mechanics

Examples:
- A Binding-focused class might gain +damage for each successful Binding kill
- A stress-manipulation class might have attacks that scale with current stress
- A debuff-focused class might have poisons/burns that stack and deal increasing damage

The scaling should feel thematic and reward players for engaging with the class's core mechanics.  

# Token cards
You may, if you like, define one or more "token" cards to be used by the cards in this class.  Token cards should have some minor useful effect and be transient (that is, exhaust on use or at end of turn.)  Token cards are generated by the class's cards.

# Card Creation Guidelines

Create all cards directly using the format below. Design cards as archetype enablers (basic functionality) or payoffs (rewards for engaging with mechanics). Balance power levels: commons provide baseline functionality, uncommons offer interesting interactions, rares provide build-defining effects.

## Card Output Format

Create cards using clear English descriptions with unambiguous mechanics:

**Card Name**: [Name]
**Cost**: [Number] energy
**Type**: Attack/Skill/Power
**Rarity**: Common/Uncommon/Rare
**Damage/Block**: [If applicable]
**Properties**: [If applicable - Ethereal, Exhaust, etc.]

**Effect**: [Single field combining all mechanical effects, buffs, debuffs, and descriptions. Include exact stack counts for all buffs/debuffs]

**Flavor Text**: [Atmospheric description]

## Power Level Guidelines

### Commons (5 cards per batch)
- Simple, straightforward effects
- 1-2 energy cost
- Basic archetype support
- 6-8 damage baseline for 1 energy attacks

### Uncommons (5 cards per batch)
- More complex interactions
- 2-3 energy cost
- Synergy with multiple archetypes
- 10-15 damage baseline for 2 energy attacks

### Rares (5 cards per batch)
- Powerful, build-defining effects
- 3-4+ energy cost
- Strong archetype payoffs
- 15-20 damage baseline for 3 energy attacks

## Buff Integration Requirements

- **Use Existing Buffs**: Reference the 100+ buffs from current_buffs_and_monster_data.md
- **Always Include Stack Counts**: Every buff/debuff must specify exact number of stacks
- **Status Effects**: Apply existing debuffs like Weak, Vulnerable, Stress, etc.
- **Combat Modifiers**: Use Lethality, Bulwark, Dexterity for power scaling
- **Avoid New Buffs**: Don't create new buffs unless absolutely necessary
- **Complex Conditions**: Use clear "if-then" or "when-then" statements for conditional effects

# Design Quality Standards

When creating cards, avoid these common pitfalls:

## Linear Upgrade Chains
- Don't create cards that are just "X but with +1 damage" or "Y but costs 1 less"
- Powers should create different build paths, not just numerical progression
- Each rarity should offer distinct gameplay, not just bigger numbers

## Boring Main Effects
- Small healing (1-5 HP) and energy gain (1-2 energy) should be riders, not primary effects
- Primary effects should be: damage, block, buffs, debuffs, or card draw
- Cards should impact combat meaningfully, not just provide tiny resource adjustments

## Out-of-Combat Resources
- Out-of-combat resources (like Essence) can only be gained through specific class mechanics, never through card effects
- Cards should rarely reference out-of-combat resources (maybe 1 rare that scales with them)
- Out-of-combat resources cannot be spent or lost via card effects - they're persistent character progression

## Dead Synergy Cards
- Cards should have baseline utility even without perfect synergy
- "If you have X, do Y" cards should still do something useful without X
- Synergy should enhance, not enable basic functionality

# The Basic Starting Deck Of The Class
The starting deck by default should be between 1-2 basic attacks and 1-2 basic blocks.  They can (but don't have to be) incredibly weak archetype enablers or payoffs.

## Thematic Integration
- Names should evoke cosmic horror
- Flavor text should enhance atmosphere
- Mechanics should feel appropriate to theme

## Mechanical Clarity
- Effects should be unambiguous
- Keywords should be clearly defined
- Interactions should be predictable

Please put classes and their cards into their own folders.
